# IMDB Task

● Problem Description:
. Create a RESTful API for movies(something similar to IMDB). For this we would like you to use:

1. MySql or SQLlite to store data
2. Any Python Framework for implementing the APIs.

There need to be 2 levels of access:
admin = who can add, remove or edit movies.
users = who can just view the movies.

. There should also be a decent implementation to search for movies.

. Document your code well so that we can test the API with ease.

. For your convenience I have attached some data that you can use to populate your database

. Try and deploy this on Heroku. Ensure that you parse the JSON file and ingest it into the application deployed on Heroku.

. Feel free to add features!
